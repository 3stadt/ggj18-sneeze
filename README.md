# Do not sneeze! 
Noone wants to transmit a disease... Well, almost noone. 
You are Betty, undercover special forces member, and you are trying stealthily to find a bio terrorist in a mall. 
Try to heal people as fast as you can, identify the bio terrorist - and kill him. Infected people spread the disease to others. But only the terrorist keeps infecting himself again. 

## Controls
W/A/S/D or arrow keys: Move - H or Space: Heal (works only from behind a person) - K or Ctrl: Kill someone (Will be punished in a future version when it's the wrong person)
